## 📝 Overview
This NotePad app provides users with a straightforward way to create, view, update, and delete notes. All notes are stored locally on the device, ensuring data privacy and offline access. The project is built entirely with native Android components and serves as a great example of implementing a complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality with a local SQLite database.

## ✨ Features
- **Create Notes:** Easily add new notes with a title and a detailed description using a dedicated "Add Note" screen.
- **View All Notes:** A clean main screen displays all saved notes in an efficient, scrollable list using a `RecyclerView`.
- **Update Existing Notes:** Tap on any note in the list to open an edit screen where you can modify its title and description.
- **Delete Notes:** Functionality to delete notes is available from the update screen, providing a complete data management lifecycle.
- **Local Data Persistence:** All notes are stored in a local **SQLite database**, ensuring that your data is saved even when the app is closed.
- **Custom UI Components:**
    -   **`RecyclerView` with `CardView`**: For a modern and efficient display of the notes list.
    -   **Custom Adapter (`NotesAdapter`)**: Manages the data flow between the SQLite database and the `RecyclerView`.
    -   **`FloatingActionButton`**: For intuitive access to the "Add Note" screen.
    -   **Menu Options**: Contextual menu items for saving, updating, and deleting notes.
- **Database Management:** A custom `MyDatabaseHelper` class handles all SQLite operations, including table creation, queries, insertions, updates, and deletions.
